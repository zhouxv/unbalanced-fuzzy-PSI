# Vectorized Batch Private Information Retrieval

This repository contains an implementation of the Vectorized Batch Private Information Retrieval (PIR) Protocol published in IEEE Security and Privacy, 2023. The protocol introduces a novel approach where both communication and computation are amortized over a batch of entries, resulting in significantly lower communication overhead for small entry sizes (ranging from 32 bytes to 256 bytes). Specifically, for a batch of 256 entries and an entry size of 32 bytes, the communication overhead is 11 times less compared to previous schemes.

The paper detailing the protocol can be found [here](https://ia.cr/2022/1262).

## Dependencies

This code relies on the [Microsoft SEAL Library](https://github.com/Microsoft/SEAL#citing-microsoft-seal). Make sure to install version 4.1 of this library globally.

## Compilation

Before proceeding with the compilation, ensure that your system has [CMake](https://cmake.org) installed, preferably a version above 3.0.

After installing CMake and the Microsoft SEAL Library, navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the following commands:

```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

本地安装SEAL的编译
```
cmake -S . -B out/build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=out/install/linux
cmake --build build

cmake -S . -B ../out/build/linux -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=../out/install/linux -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../out/install/linux
cmake --build ../out/build/linux
cmake --install ../out/build/linux --config release
cmake --install /home/dinglab-dell/researches/new_idea/deadline/out/bitpolymul/out/build/linux' '--config' 'Release' '--prefix' '/home/dinglab-dell/researches/new_idea/deadline/out/install/linux'
```

Once the build process is complete, run the following command to execute the Vectorized Batch PIR:

```
./build/bin/vectorized_batch_pir
```

This will run the Vectorized Batch PIR for the three input scenarios mentioned below:

| Batch Size | Database Size | Entry Size |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| 32         | 1048576       | 32         |
| 64         | 1048576       | 32         |
| 256        | 1048576       | 32         |

## Expected Output

Upon processing the inputs, the terminal should display a similar output:

## FHE Parameter Selection

The performance of the protocol heavily relies on the selection of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) parameters. We have provided the best-performing parameters for the given example inputs. However, we encourage developers to select the parameters that yield the best performance for their specific applications. Please refer to [this section](https://github.com/mhmughees/vectorized_batchpir/blob/370780f0bd58a99f18dda60e6fb2cde5c2e815f4/src/utils.h#L108) for parameter selection details.
